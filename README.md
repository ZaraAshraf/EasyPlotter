# EasyPlotter
An Easy plotter that can plot multiple CSV files.
***
A simple graph plotter that uses numpy and matplotlib to plot a simple 2D graph.
>I built this because I had an objective in a university course to compare betweeen different Algorithms' runtimes given different number of inputs through plotting graphs in Microsoft Excel, and since I'm lazy and broke I decided to take the easy way and plot through this python script I wrote , But I cleaned it a bit and made it usable so here it is.

>The plotter supports various colors
